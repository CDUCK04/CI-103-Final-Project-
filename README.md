This project, developed by Team 6, is a game prototype designed and implemented in Unity with core functionality powered by C#. It showcases essential gameplay elements like character controls, NPC management, and environment interaction, all built within a modular, scalable code structure. 
Through the integration of object-oriented principles and modular code organization, the project delivers a solid foundation for gameplay that can be further expanded and enhanced. Me Teimurazi Bakuradze worked on back end and wrote 99% of the code while other members helped me 
with UI/UX, frontend and with the assembly of the enviroments. This project was very important to us and each member has put significant time in working on this. 

Key Features
Character Controls: Implements responsive player controls using the Unity Input System, enhancing the player experience with smooth movement and interaction.
NPC Management: Includes custom NPC behaviors through the NPCController script, creating dynamic interactions that bring the game world to life.
Combat System: A dedicated Combat folder contains scripts that handle character combat mechanics, offering a structured approach to implement engaging battle scenarios.
Power-Ups and Environmental Interactions: Adds elements like SpeedBoost and environmental controls that enrich gameplay and add variety to player interactions.
Dynamic Spawning: Uses a Spawner script to control the generation of NPCs and game objects, contributing to a dynamic and evolving game environment.

Core Concepts and Strengths
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Modularity: Each feature, from player controls to NPC behavior, is encapsulated within its own class, making the project highly modular and easy to maintain.
Polymorphism: Some scripts demonstrate polymorphic behavior, especially in the way they handle different game objects, providing flexibility for future game expansions.
2. Unity Input System
InputReader and Controls Scripts: Utilizes the Unity Input System for streamlined and responsive player input, allowing players to navigate and interact seamlessly.
Free Look Camera: An adjustable camera system that enhances gameplay visuals and supports player orientation, contributing to an immersive player experience.
3. State Management and Interactivity
State Machines: Includes state machine architecture for NPCs and player states, allowing for structured and easily modifiable character behaviors.
Event-Driven Spawning: The spawner component reacts to specific game events, enabling dynamic world changes that keep gameplay engaging.
4. Environmental Effects and UI
UI Elements: Includes custom UI components such as health bars and game-over screens to guide players and improve the user experience.
Environmental Prefabs: Prefabs for objects like hallways and environment assets provide visual consistency and make world-building efficient.
